                  In my high school Computer Science course, I worked with two others to create a game in Java called Copaint. It was a game in which users would be able to “paint” images on a Computer panel with their cursor. After creating images, users would be able to share them with one another, and vote on the best picture. I created the interface that would allow game players to paint with brushes, shapes, colors, and various other tools. One challenge of the project was creating a bucket tool that would change all adjacent pixels of the same color to a different selected color. I tried using recursive logic, however my method was called too many times, and so I got a stack overflow error. I ended up having to use the stack data structure, so that less of the computer’s stack would be used.

                At Stanford Linear Accelerator, one of the main projects I worked on was a Python calculator that would compute the diffraction grating that would be needed to produce a wavelength of light that would be needed for an experiment. The difficulty was that the equation for the diffraction grating was too complicated to directly find an answer (ie solving for x in the equation y =xsin(x)), so I had to utilize a binary search that would be able to estimate the diffraction grating.

                At HuskieHack 2015 (my first hackathon), I joined a group of four to create a website that could be used to promote and improve the recycling process. Some stores offer to recycle bottles for you, and give money in return. We decided to create a machine that would automate the process. We wrote software that would be able to recognize a bottle, and add money to a user’s account on the website. The user can choose to withdraw their money from the account whenever they please. I was responsible for implementing the feature that allows information about a user (their username, password, name, balance, etc.) to be stored in a database, and changed as necessary. While working on the project, I was introduced to a simple backend web development framework called Flask. You can take a look at this project on my Github page.

                In Fall 2015, I worked on an audio steganography project in an honors computer science course. My group and I created a website that would allow a user to hide text within a wav or mp3 file. The least significant bytes in every sequence within the wav files were changed, so that the message could be encoded without creating audible differences when it was played. I was responsible for creating a backend environment for the site (with Python and Flask), that would handle user input and interact with the frontend of the website. See more about it on my github!
